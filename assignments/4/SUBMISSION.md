#Brief description of implementation:
I created a responsive JavaScript calculator using Html,css,ES6 javascript.  
The interface is styled to resemble a modern mobile calculator, using CSS Grid for layout and clearly differentiated colors for numbers, operations, and utility buttons.  
JavaScript handles all calculator logic:  
Updating the display dynamically when new digit is entered,Managing state for current input, previous value, and operator  
Performing arithmetic operations by taking the user inputs
Handling errors (examples, division by zero → displays “Error”)   
It’s integrated into my portfolio as a standalone project with a “Back to Portfolio” button for smooth navigation to profile.

#Challenges Faced.
One of the main challenges I faced was getting the “Back to Portfolio” button to work correctly.
At first, the link didn’t go to the right page because the file paths between my calculator and portfolio pages were not matching.
After checking my folder structure and fixing the link paths, the button started working properly on both my local computer and the live GitHub Pages site.

#Any additional features or improvements you added beyond the requirements  
->Theme Switcher for the css styles and light and dark themes toggle button.
->Memory Functions  
Fully implemented memory operations using an arrays for easy data usage:  
- M+ → Add displayed value to memory  
- M- → Subtract displayed value from memory  
- MR → Recall and display stored total  
- MC → Clear memory  


#Acknowledgment of any resources, tutorials, or code snippets you used
- I watched some youtube tutorial for pages navigation implement for the back to profile button.
- Referenced javascript MDN for documentation on arrays methods and others
- Tested code in vs code and validated functionality before deployment on GitHub Pages.
